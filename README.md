# Data-Visualization-and-Story-Telling-with-AI

Introduction
In an era of ubiquitous artificial intelligence, I leverage AI and large language models (LLMs) as
pedagogical tools to deepen student learning. In my undergraduate course Data Visualization and
Storytelling with AI (DAT-230), students learn core visualization principles, modern web development,
and hardware integration while collaborating with AI assistants. The overarching goal is to
empower students as critical thinkers who can harness LLMs for ideation, coding, and analysis,
rather than using them as “oracles”. This integration is driven by a clear rationale: by offloading
boilerplate coding tasks and offering on-demand guidance, AI tools lower barriers for students
(even those with no programming background) to engage in real-world data projects. The emphasis
remains on understanding, iteration, and explanation over mere polished outputs. In practice,
this means students are taught to design effective prompts and to verify every AI-generated result,
aligning with a stated learning outcome that they “refine prompts to obtain, debug, and explain
R code from LLMs, validating outputs critically”. Such an approach not only keeps the human
in control of the problem-solving process but also instills responsible technology use by requiring
transparent documentation and skepticism of AI outputs. Overall, the pedagogical strategy positions
AI as a catalyst for deeper learning: students tackle complex, authentic projects with AI
support, developing both technical skills and the judgment to use these tools ethically in today’s
data-driven world.
1 Instructional Strategies
The course is structured around a series of LLM-integrated case studies and projects that progressively
build student skills. Each case study introduces realistic datasets or scenarios and requires
students to use prompt engineering and AI-assisted coding in service of clear learning objectives.
Crucially, every use of an AI tool is coupled with careful
